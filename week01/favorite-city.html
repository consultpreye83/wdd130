    <h1>MY FAVORITE CITY</h1>
    <P>Pretoria is the administrative capital of South Africa serving as the seat of the executive branch of government,
        and as
        the host to all foreign embassies to the country.
        Pretoria straddles the Apies River and extends eastward into the foothills of the Magaliesberg mountains. It has
        a
        reputation as an academic city and centre of research, being home to the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT),
        the
        University of Pretoria (UP), the University of South Africa (UNISA), the Council for Scientific and Industrial
        Research
        (CSIR), and the Human Sciences Research Council. It also hosts the National Research Foundation and the South
        African
        Bureau of Standards. Pretoria was one of the host cities of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.</P>
